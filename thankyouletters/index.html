					Thank You Letters
				</h2>
				<p>
					"Thank you for your wonderful crew at Viking Pavers for accepting our challenge and turning our dilapidated and dysfunctional backyard (consisting of cracked cement and broken down cinder block planters) into a pleasant outback retreat. Because of your "expertise" we're spared from the once felt delirium and are now proud to bring out family and friends out back for a barbeque. The pavers patio gave us the room needed for a nice size table and chairs and more seating with the new planter box/sitting walls and the synthetic grass adds a nice softness and compliments the landscape. We gave you an ugly duckling to work with and you gave us back a swan, far exceeding our expectations! A <span class="semiboldred">great job done, always prompt, courteous and professional for a very reasonable price.</span> We are recommending Viking Pavers to everyone!"

					"Viking Pavers worked on our backyard at the end of 2010. <span class="semiboldred">The work is outstanding.</span> They made a 6 foot retaining wall and reinforced an old wall to be able to withstand a jacuzzi. They also replaced a set of steps leading to the front of the house and built a paver patio. The neighbor's house is currently on the market and even the broker selling the house has commented on the workmanship and the quality of the work done. We are so happy with the work they did and are waiting for our summer to come in San Francisco so we can really enjoy it!"

					"Just a note to let you know how pleased we are with the work you and your crew did on our driveway/parking pad. <span class="semiboldred">You came in on budget, on time and worked around some curves I threw your way with exceptional professionalism. I know 90% of a good job is in the preparation and it is unfortunate that your superior foundation, grading and subsurface prep is hidden by the pavers.</span> I will say that as we enjoy the appearance, my pleasure will be greatly enhanced knowing what lies beneath the surface."

					"We hired Viking Pavers because we saw the work they did for our neighbors. At the beginning, they worked with us to find the right materials, delivered samples to our house, and made sure that all aspects of the work to be done were clear. Once they started work, they made quick progress, but always kept in constant contact to make sure there were no mix-ups. They kept a neat job site and the work crew was very polite and easy to work with. At the end, I can say <span class="semiboldred">they delivered a product better than what the contract called for (they added a number of small additional requests at no cost).</span> Overall, it was an excellent experience from beginning to end and we would use them again without hesitation."

You and the entire Viking team are to be commended for your professionalism and hard work. <span class="semiboldred">Not only was the outcome top quality, but your pricing was very competitive.</span> Please feel free to use us as references."

					Working with you was a pleasure and we look forward to using Viking Pavers for future projects and will recommend you to all of our friends. Please feel free to have anyone contact us for a reference."

					"I think you know how much we love our patio. It's made a huge difference in our lives. We enjoy going outside at all times of year, something that was difficult when our feet got soaked and muddy. It's as pretty as can be and has encouraged me to install a beautiful fire pit, as well as to enhance the garden. I recently set a 5" round teak table and six chairs out there. Really, it's like having another room on the house. <span class="semiboldred">We recommend your work heartily!</span>"

					"We wanted to thank you and your team for the amazing job you did on our driveway. The transformation is incredible. <span class="semiboldred">We could not have asked for a more professional, detailed company to work with. Your follow-up and constant attention to our project was appreciated.</span> Please use us as a future referral anytime. We look forward to having more work done by Viking Pavers."

					"We wanted to take the opportunity to thank Viking Pavers for such a <span class="semiboldred">wonderful job performed</span> at our home for the installation of pavers and bullnose to complete a foundation for our hot tub. It often seems like everyone always has time to complain but never time to sit down and thank such a wonderful company for a job well done.
				</p>
				<p>
					Our job started out with the estimate. We were shown pictures of the many possibilities of what our project could look like with the many different colors, styles and options. Once we finally decided on the paver color and type, you kept us well informed as to what was happening, and helped us make decisions with steps and nice accents that would help with the value of our home and foundation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Even during the middle of the project, <span class="semiboldred">your company was always available by phone and your crew was very thorough and knowledgeable from start to finish</span>. We are eventually going to put the some pavers in where our old concrete patio is and without hesitation, we will be using Viking Pavers to do the job. It's people like you that can help make real-life decisions and suggestions that really help to make a successful project and to this, we are very thankful."

					"I did a background and reference check on Viking Pavers and everything was clear! The day the crew started was absolutely amazing. They had a convoy of trucks come in with all of their equipment. Their energetic and happy crew got to work right away. They had the demo done in a day and started right away on everything else. <span class="semiboldred">They timed everything so the project ran smoothly.</span> I was actually happy to pay for the excellent work they did. <span class="semiboldred">They went above and beyond our expectations</span> making sure we signed off on everything that was done. Viking Pavers is a top notch operation and we are very pleased with the work they did for us. We always get compliments from neighbors and passer-byes, but it's our continued happiness and satisfaction with the results that make us feel great."

					"I just wanted to take a moment to tell anyone considering a project with pavers that I couldn't be happier with the job Viking Pavers did with my new driveway. They really spent time with me to pick out the style and design that would look great with the space I had, and was open and willing to listen to my thoughts as well as offering suggestions from their experience. Once the work was started, <span class="semiboldred">I was amazed with the timeliness that it was completed and how tidy the yard was when the workers left</span>. I have received many compliments from total strangers walking by my house and I feel like I have added value to the neighborhood as well as my property.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="semiboldred">You can certainly spend more for your project, but I don't think you can get a better quality of workmanship than Viking Pavers!</span>"
